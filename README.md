## About

I wasn't on the live front because of the time zone difference (I was in the Discord server before), so I wanted to save the version I already saved via GitHub.

I found a better archive -- lewiscooldukealt's [TheBrokenScriptArchive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DhFk-q9jJbgr9zt8SK-tgk5NVljb3ZbK) on GoogleDisk.

Therefore, this repo only used as a backup.
